## Prerequisites

Before installing Asymptote, you must have:
- A GitHub account with admin access to the repositories you plan to connect
- One or more GitHub repositories where you want Asymptote to help detect and prevent code vulnerabilities

## Installing Asymptote

### Step 1: Sign up for Asymptote

Visit [Asymptote](https://asymptotelabs.ai/login) to create a new account. You can sign up with Google or GitHub, or use your email address and set a password.

Your account gives you access to the Asymptote dashboard, where you can:
- Configure custom security policies
- See vulnerabilities we've detected (and the ones we've already remediated)
- Track security and remediation metrics over time

### Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Account

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize GitHub Integration">
    You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize Asymptote's access to your repositories. Asymptote requires the following permissions:

    - **Read access** to repository code and metadata
    - **Webhook access** to receive real-time repository updates
    - **Read and write access** to checks and commit statuses, issues and pull requests, and repository webhooks

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repositories">
    Select which repositories you want Asymptote to connect to. You can:

    - Grant access to all repositories in your organization, or
    - Select specific repositories now

    You can add more repositories later from the Asymptote dashboard if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Create an Asymptote Secret key

In the Asymptote Dashboard, navigate to the API Keys tab. Create a new secret key, apply the relevant scopes, and set a desired expiration (optional).
