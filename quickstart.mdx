## Prerequisites

Before installing Asymptote, you must have:
- A GitHub account with admin access to the repositories you plan to connect
- One or more GitHub repositories where you want Asymptote to help detect and prevent code vulnerabilities

## Installing Asymptote

### Step 1: Sign up for Asymptote

Visit [Asymptote](https://asymptotelabs.ai/login) to create a new account. You can sign up with Google or GitHub, or use your email address and set a password.

Your account includes access to the Asymptote dashboard, where you can:

- **Define and manage security policies** that match your team's standards
- **Review detected vulnerabilities**, including what was fixed automatically and what still needs action
- **Track product security and remediation trends** over time with clear metrics and reporting

### Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Account

  <Step title="Authorize GitHub Integration">
    You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize Asymptote's access to your repositories. Asymptote requires the following permissions:

    - **Read access** to repository code and metadata
    - **Webhook access** to receive real-time repository updates
    - **Read and write access** to checks and commit statuses, issues and pull requests, and repository webhooks

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repositories">
    Select which repositories you want Asymptote to connect to. You can:

    - Grant access to all repositories in your organization, or
    - Select specific repositories now

    You can add more repositories later from the Asymptote dashboard if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Create a new Secret Key

Navigate to the **API Keys** tab in the Asymptote Dashboard.
