## Core Components

### Scanner Engine

The scanner engine is the heart of Asymptote. It performs static analysis on your code to identify security vulnerabilities.

- **Language Support** - Supports multiple programming languages
- **Pattern Matching** - Uses advanced pattern matching algorithms
- **Context Awareness** - Understands code context for accurate results

### Policy Engine

The policy engine allows you to define and enforce security policies across your organization.

- **Custom Rules** - Create rules specific to your organization
- **Industry Standards** - Built-in support for OWASP, CWE, and more
- **Severity Levels** - Categorize issues by severity

### Integration Layer

Seamlessly connect Asymptote with your existing tools and workflows.

- **Version Control** - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Communication** - Slack, Teams, Email

## Data Flow

1. Code is submitted for analysis via CLI, CI/CD, or API
2. Scanner engine analyzes the code against policies
3. Results are processed and stored
4. Notifications are sent based on configuration
5. Reports are generated and made available

## Security

All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We follow industry best practices for security and compliance.
