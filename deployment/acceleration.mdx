# Scan Acceleration

Asymptote provides several mechanisms to accelerate scanning for large codebases.

## Overview

When working with large codebases, scan times can become significant. Asymptote offers several optimization techniques to improve performance.

## Caching

Asymptote caches analysis results to avoid re-scanning unchanged files.

```bash
asymptote scan --cache enabled
```

### Cache Configuration

Configure caching behavior in your `asymptote.yaml`:

```yaml
cache:
  enabled: true
  ttl: 3600  # Cache TTL in seconds
  strategy: incremental
```

## Incremental Scanning

Only scan files that have changed since the last scan:

```bash
asymptote scan --incremental
```

This is especially useful in CI/CD pipelines where you want to scan only the changes in a pull request.

## Parallel Processing

Asymptote can parallelize scanning across multiple cores:

```bash
asymptote scan --parallel 4
```

### Auto-detection

By default, Asymptote will auto-detect the optimal number of parallel workers:

```yaml
performance:
  parallel: auto
  max_workers: 8
```

## Exclusions

Exclude files and directories that don't need scanning:

```yaml
exclude:
  - node_modules/
  - vendor/
  - "*.test.js"
  - "*.spec.ts"
```
