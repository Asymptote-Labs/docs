# Tasks

Tasks allow you to automate common workflows and operations in Asymptote.

## Overview

Tasks are predefined workflows that can be triggered manually or automatically based on events.

## Creating Tasks

Define tasks in your `asymptote.yaml`:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: full-scan
    description: Run a complete security scan
    steps:
      - scan:
          scope: all
          severity: [critical, high, medium]
      - report:
          format: sarif
          output: ./reports/

  - name: quick-check
    description: Quick scan of critical issues only
    steps:
      - scan:
          scope: changed
          severity: [critical]
```

## Running Tasks

Execute a task using the CLI:

```bash
asymptote task run full-scan
```

## Scheduled Tasks

Schedule tasks to run automatically:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: nightly-scan
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Run at 2 AM daily
    steps:
      - scan:
          scope: all
      - notify:
          channel: slack
```

## Task Parameters

Tasks can accept parameters:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: targeted-scan
    params:
      - name: path
        type: string
        required: true
    steps:
      - scan:
          path: "{{ params.path }}"
```

Run with parameters:

```bash
asymptote task run targeted-scan --param path=./src/api
```

## Built-in Tasks

| Task | Description |
