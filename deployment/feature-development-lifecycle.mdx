# Feature Development Lifecycle

Understand the lifecycle of developing, testing, and deploying features with Asymptote.

## Overview

The feature development lifecycle in Asymptote follows a structured approach to ensure quality and reliability.

## Stages

### 1. Development

During development, you can use local scanning to test your policies and configurations.

```bash
asymptote scan --local ./src
```

### 2. Testing

Use branch deployments to test changes in an isolated environment.

```bash
asymptote scan --branch feature-branch
```

### 3. Staging

Deploy to a staging environment to validate changes before production.

```bash
asymptote deploy --env staging
```

### 4. Production

Once validated, deploy changes to production.

```bash
asymptote deploy --env production
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Branch Deployments">
    Always test changes in a branch deployment before merging to main.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Incremental Changes">
    Make small, incremental changes to minimize risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Results">
    Keep an eye on scan results after deploying changes.

## Rollback

If issues are discovered, you can quickly rollback to a previous configuration:

```bash
asymptote rollback --version previous
```
