# Working with Branches

Branch deployments allow users to quickly iterate on features and configurations. When working in a branch users have a number of useful capabilities, including:

- Asymptote can automatically watch your files and deploy any changes
- Updates to your project are deployed in seconds
- Quickly test policy changes to see the effects
- Branches have a consistent name across deployments

<Note>
Branch deployments do not pick up changes to environment variables or secrets, so these changes would require a new non-branch deployment to take effect.
</Note>

## Create a Branch Deployment

To create a branch, simply run:

```bash
asymptote scan --branch <branch_name>
```

Asymptote will create a new branch in the environment that you can interact with.

## Continuously Deploy Changes

You can ask the Asymptote CLI to continuously deploy changes to your branch using the watch flag:

```bash
asymptote watch --branch <branch_name>
```

Asymptote will automatically keep the branch up to date as you make changes locally.

## Develop Locally

One of the major advantages of branch deployments is the flexibility they offer when working locally. Once you've deployed a branch, you can iteratively edit policies and configurations and see the effects immediately.

## Example

In the following example we add a new security policy to an existing configuration:

```yaml
# asymptote.yaml
policies:
  - name: sql-injection
    severity: critical
    enabled: true
  - name: xss-prevention  # New policy
    severity: high
    enabled: true
```

Deploy the branch to test:

```bash
asymptote scan --branch test-xss-policy
```

Review the results and iterate as needed.
