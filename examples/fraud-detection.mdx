# Fraud Detection Pipeline

Learn how to set up a comprehensive security scanning pipeline for fraud detection applications.

## Overview

Fraud detection systems handle sensitive financial data and require robust security measures. This guide walks through setting up Asymptote to scan a fraud detection pipeline.

## Architecture

A typical fraud detection system includes:

- Data ingestion from payment processors
- Feature engineering for ML models
- Real-time scoring APIs
- Database storage for transactions

## Configuration

### Step 1: Define Policies

Create policies specific to financial applications:

```yaml
# asymptote.yaml
policies:
  - name: pci-dss
    description: PCI-DSS compliance checks
    severity: critical
    enabled: true
    
  - name: sensitive-data
    description: Detect exposed PII and financial data
    severity: critical
    rules:
      - credit-card-numbers
      - ssn-exposure
      - account-numbers

  - name: sql-injection
    description: SQL injection prevention
    severity: critical
    enabled: true
    
  - name: authentication
    description: Authentication security
    severity: high
    rules:
      - weak-passwords
      - missing-mfa
      - session-management
```

### Step 2: Configure Scanning

Set up scanning for your fraud detection codebase:

```yaml
# asymptote.yaml
scan:
  paths:
    - ./src/
    - ./api/
    - ./models/
  exclude:
    - ./tests/
    - ./data/samples/
    
  languages:
    - python
    - sql
    - yaml
```

### Step 3: CI/CD Integration

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  asymptote-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run Asymptote
        uses: asymptote/scan-action@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ASYMPTOTE_API_KEY }}
          policies: pci-dss,sensitive-data,sql-injection
          fail-on: critical
```

## Common Findings

### Exposed API Keys

```python
# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded API key
stripe_key = "sk_live_abc123..."

# ✅ Good: Use environment variables
stripe_key = os.environ.get("STRIPE_API_KEY")
```

### SQL Injection

```python
# ❌ Bad: String interpolation
query = f"SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE user_id = {user_id}"

# ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
query = "SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE user_id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### Sensitive Data Logging

```python
# ❌ Bad: Logging sensitive data
logger.info(f"Processing card: {card_number}")

# ✅ Good: Mask sensitive data
logger.info(f"Processing card: ****{card_number[-4:]}")
```

## Results

After running the scan, review findings in the Asymptote dashboard:

| Finding | Severity | File | Line |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| Hardcoded API key | Critical | config.py | 15 |
| SQL injection risk | Critical | queries.py | 42 |
| Missing input validation | High | api/handlers.py | 88 |

## Next Steps

1. Remediate critical findings
2. Enable continuous monitoring
3. Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities
