# Feature Versions

Learn how to manage different versions of your security configurations and policies.

## Overview

As your security requirements evolve, you'll need to version your configurations to:

- Track changes over time
- Roll back to previous configurations
- Test new policies before deployment
- Maintain compliance audit trails

## Versioning Strategies

### Git-Based Versioning

Store your Asymptote configuration in version control:

```
project/
├── asymptote.yaml           # Current configuration
├── .asymptote/
│   ├── policies/
│   │   ├── v1.0/
│   │   │   └── policies.yaml
│   │   ├── v1.1/
│   │   │   └── policies.yaml
│   │   └── v2.0/
│   │       └── policies.yaml
│   └── history.json
```

### Explicit Versioning

Add version metadata to your configuration:

```yaml
# asymptote.yaml
version: "2.0"
metadata:
  created: "2024-01-15"
  author: "security-team"
  changelog: "Added PCI-DSS policies"

policies:
  # ... policy definitions
```

## Creating a New Version

### Step 1: Create Version Branch

```bash
git checkout -b config/v2.1
```

### Step 2: Update Configuration

```yaml
# asymptote.yaml
version: "2.1"
metadata:
  created: "2024-02-01"
  author: "security-team"
  changelog: "Enhanced SQL injection detection"

policies:
  - name: sql-injection-v2
    description: Enhanced SQL injection detection
    severity: critical
    rules:
      - prepared-statements
      - orm-usage
      - input-sanitization
```

### Step 3: Test New Version

```bash
asymptote scan --branch config-v2.1
```

### Step 4: Review Results

Compare results between versions:

```bash
asymptote diff --version 2.0 --version 2.1
```

Output:

```
Version Comparison: 2.0 → 2.1

New Rules Added:
  + orm-usage (sql-injection-v2)
  + input-sanitization (sql-injection-v2)

Rules Removed:
  - legacy-sql-check

Findings Difference:
  v2.0: 15 findings
  v2.1: 23 findings (+8)
  
  New Findings:
  - 5 x orm-usage violations
  - 3 x input-sanitization warnings
```

### Step 5: Deploy Version

```bash
git checkout main
git merge config/v2.1
asymptote deploy --version 2.1
```

## Rollback

If issues arise, rollback to a previous version:

```bash
asymptote rollback --version 2.0
```

## Version History

View version history:

```bash
asymptote versions list
```

```
VERSION  DATE        AUTHOR          CHANGELOG
2.1      2024-02-01  security-team   Enhanced SQL injection detection
2.0      2024-01-15  security-team   Added PCI-DSS policies
1.1      2023-12-01  security-team   Bug fixes
1.0      2023-11-01  security-team   Initial release
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Semantic Versioning" icon="code-branch">
    Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for configurations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Changelog" icon="scroll">
    Document changes in each version for audit purposes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Before Deploy" icon="flask">
    Always test new versions in a branch before deploying.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automate Rollbacks" icon="rotate-left">
    Set up automated rollbacks for failed deployments.
