# asymptote watch

Watch for code changes and scan in real-time. This is useful during development to catch issues as you write code.

```bash
asymptote watch [path] [flags]
```

## Usage

Watch the current directory:

```bash
asymptote watch
```

Watch a specific path:

```bash
asymptote watch ./src
```

## IDE Integration

Watch mode works great alongside your IDE. Run it in a separate terminal while you code to get instant feedback on security issues.
