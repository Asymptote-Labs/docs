# asymptote monitor

Monitor AI coding sessions for security violations in real-time. This command intercepts AI-generated code suggestions and scans them before they're applied.

```bash
asymptote monitor [flags]
```

## Usage

Start monitoring your IDE:

```bash
asymptote monitor --ide cursor
```

<Accordion title="Example output">
```bash
$ asymptote monitor --ide cursor

[14:35:18] AI suggestion scanned - ✓ Safe
[14:36:01] AI suggestion scanned - ✓ Safe
[14:37:22] AI suggestion scanned - ⚠ Warning (console.log in production code)
```
</Accordion>

## Flags

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--ide <ide>` | string | IDE to monitor (cursor, vscode, windsurf) |
| `--block` | bool | Block code that violates policies (default: warn only) |
| `--severity <level>` | string | Minimum severity to act on |
| `--notify` | bool | Send desktop notifications |

## Blocking Mode

By default, monitor mode only warns about issues. Enable blocking to prevent violations:

```bash
asymptote monitor --ide cursor --block

Blocking mode will prevent AI suggestions that violate your policies from being applied. Make sure your policies are configured correctly before enabling.
